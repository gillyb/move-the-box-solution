move-the-box-solution
=====================

A programmed solution to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/move-the-box/id491113310?mt=8">move-the-box</a> iphone game
<br/><br/>
This code solves the 'Move The Box' game by doing a brute-force of all the possible combinations in a certain level.<br/>
You need to create the map of that level, and tell it how many moves it has, and the program will solve the puzzle. It can take a couple of minutes for boards that have 3 moves to the solution.<br/>
Written in C#

This is old code of mine just recently ported to github from code.google.com.
